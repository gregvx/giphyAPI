# giphyAPI

[Visit page here](https://gregvx.github.io/giphyAPI/)
This app performs ajax calls to the giphy api to get images of various cartoon characters.

There is a set of default characters already in the top section of the page

There is a text box to allow the user to create additional buttons for other characters to get gifs for. 

The app uses little styling and is does not have a pretty UI. The focus here was on the functionality.
